<h1 align="center"> Project 1 for Code Institute formation | Cripullette Crochet - HTML & CSS</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://laurepiechaczyk.github.io/project1_code_institute_Laure_Piechaczyk/)

Cripulette Crochet is a website built as part of a project for the code institute (training to become a web developer) in order to develop and show my skills in HTML and CSS. 

To do this, I invented a small business that offers courses and workshops to learn crochet.

# About the project 
In order to practice, develop and demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills, I created the responsive website Cripulette Crochet. Cripulette Crochet is an invented small company that offers courses and workshops to learn crochet. 
I have choosen this theme because I crochet myself and I deeply believe that in our computer-driven world, we should all make time for handmade creations.

Nevertheless, the main objective of this site is to train with HTML and CSS. For this reason, I made the decision to use these two languages almost exclusively. I also chose to avoid using Bootstrap because I wanted to learn and consolidate my ability to write CSS code and control all the elements. I used a little bit of Javascript for some functionality but focused on HTML and CSS.

# The target audience
The target audience of Cripulette Crochet is adults who crochet or want to learn to crochet. The site offers courses and workshops to learn and improve crochet as well as to find new inspiration by making creations on various themes.

I expect this site to be exchanged between "crocheters" by sending the link to each other as word of mouth is important among crocheters. However, the site is also aimed at people who are looking for crochet classes/workshops in their neighbourhood, even if they don't know anyone.

# User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories
The target users are adults who enjoy doing crafts such as crocheting, knitting and sewing. They are likely to have some of the following characteristics:
1. They like to create and express themselves through small pieces of art that they have created themselves.
2. They are persistent in their work and are not afraid to spend time on a project to complete it.
3. They are patient and enjoy spending hours doing activities in a quiet environment. 
4. They are willing to improve their skills. 
5. They are keen to meet other people who share the same hobby. 
6. They like or need to cut themselves off from the digital world.

This last point made me raise an interesting question: How do you attract people who might want to avoid the media by using the media? 

So I built the site with this in mind and made design choices that seemed relevant to allow users to feel in a calm and welcoming environment when browsing the site.

-   #### Visitor Goals
1. To feel calm and stay relax.
2. Find the offers/information rapidly.
3. Get motivation and inspiration even if the user does not register for a course.
4. That the user like the website and offers enough to share it with friends. 

-   ### Main design choices
    -   #### Theme Colors
        Theme colors were inspirided from palettes that offer a calm feeling (details in credits) while stimulating the curiosity and thus the creativity by adding Yellow-Orange colors.

    -   #### Background
        A background image has been added to give a 3D feel and to give the feeling that the background can be touched. I expect many users like to touch fabrics and surfaces so I added a background that gives that feeling.
        For visual cohesion, the image was also used for the headings and footer and the top colors were transparent at 0.7 to allow subtle viewing of the background image.
            
    -   #### Pictures
        1. Homepage
        For the design of the homepage, I wanted to focus on the process of creation and not on a final creation. That is why I have chosen images showing wool, hooks and the process of making crochet.
        The reason is that I did not want to influence the user's imagination on the homepage.
        2. Courses and Workshops
        For this page, I have tried to choose photos that illustrate the proposed course and worshop.  
        3. Gallery
        I have tried to illustrate the diversity of creations that can be made with crochet as well as the different technical levels of creations. As I used royalty free images, I was limited in the images I could use and I think the diversity of crochet could have been better illustrated.

    -   ### Fonts
        The Cursiv font was chosen for the body text on large and medium-sized screens because it gives the impression of handwriting, which I suppose is attractive to people looking for manual activities. For small screens such as phones, the Roboto font was used for readability reasons. After testing the site on a phone, I realised that the cursiv font was really difficult to read. So I opted for the more readable Roboto font, as I felt that the accessibility of the information was more important than the aesthetics and feel of handwriting.
        The Serif font was chosen for the headlines because I find its combination with the Serif font pleasant. Moreover, this combination gives, in my opinion, a clean look with an artistic touch.

    -   ####  Interactivity, animations and geometric shapes
        Little interactivity and animation was added to the website to keep it simple and relaxing. Some shapes containing phrases from famous artists were displayed in a non-straight position to attract readers' attention, but the site was kept simple.

    -   #### Border-radius
        The radii of the edges have been rounded to give a more tranquil feel.


## Wireframes

# Features 
The site is structured in 4 web pages with a link on the navbar + 1 page (calendar) accessible only from the "Courses" page. Some links have been strategically placed to allow easy navigation to the relevant sub-sections. e.g. Weekly courses button on the homepage.

-   #### Responsivness
    The website is designed to be suitable for all devices. For example, the responsive navigation bar turns into a burger button for phone screens.
    Similarly, the text in some sections has been modified to suit the screen size. This was done to provide more complete information for computer users while allowing phone users to focus on the main information.
<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/Picture-readme/Burger.png"></h2>

-   #### Animations
    For design reasons, there is very little animation on this site. To make it easier for the user to navigate, the background colour and the filling of the links in the navigation bar change when the mouse passes over them.
<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/Picture-readme/over.png"></h2>
  
@keyframe was used to change the background colour of the buttons for the price and details on the course web page. However, I expect that this animation will be noticed mainly by people who browse the website quickly and expect to reach the detailed information quickly.

  -   ####   Position of elements and geometric shapes
Care has been taken to position the elements in the different screen sizes. Similarly, in the Courses and Workshops page, geometric shapes containing famous quotes have been used as separators between sections.

# Credits

## Inspiration credits

- ### Theme Colors
The colors of the theme were inspired by the palettes :  [Del Rio Gray Iceberg Powder Blue Color Palette](https://colorideas.net/del-rio-gray-iceberg-powder-blue-color-palette/) and [iColorpalette](https://icolorpalette.com/imagepalette/color-palette-ideas-from-horizon-sky-shore-image-2).

I was inspired by these palettes because they give an overall sense of calm and the addition of the colour orange stimulates curiosity and therefore creativity.

- ### Sections of the webpage
The "4 good reasons to learn crochet" section and gallery were inspired by a walkthrought project with [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) called love running.

- ### Website content
Some of the content of the website was inspired by [ammoniteyarns](https://www.ammoniteyarns.co.uk/).

## Code credits

## Read me file credits
As this is the first 'Readme' file I've done, I've read the 'readme' of many students who were kind enough to share their first projects and 'read me' files from different sources found on Github.
The 'Readme' file from [LogisticBravo](https://github.com/LogisticBravo/Milestone_Project-1-3DPrintQ) was a great source of inspiration.

# Tests
On 25 July 2021, all pages were checked with [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and error were found.
However, the code has been tested before and found to have errors. 
With regard to the verification of the HTML code, two duplicate tags had to be removed and the iframe tags used to link google mag and google calender had to be corrected, as advised by the [W3C Markup Validation Service] (https://validator.w3.org/).
The css checker revealed an erroneous link to google fonts which has now been removed.

# Deployment
The website has been deployed with github.
- In the Github repository:
    - Go to Settings
    - Then GitHub Pages
    - Select Branch main
    - Save
    - Visit the website by following the link

# What could have been made better
- Fonts
As I did not noticed the fonts 

- More time before starting

- More classes - less ids

The original fonts chosen from the google font site were: 'Sacramento' and 'Josefin Slab'. However, I made a mistake when I copied the link, and did not work with these fonts. I realised towards the end of the project the error, corrected the link but realised I preferred the previous fonts and so deleted the link for the 'Sacramento' and 'Josefin Slab' fonts.


# Conclusion
This project permitted to deeper and consolidate my knowlgde in HTML and CSS. 
Having knowledge in coding language to analyse data because of a scientific bacground and the used of mostly R to analyse own data, I had the naivty to expect to manage rapidly CSS.
However, I found that even if the logic of CSS seemed at first easy, the reality of using it and controlling all elements was quite challenging. It requires in my opinion a really well knowledge of a huge amount of ... which I am still far to know or even imagine all of them. Which is great because I know I will do much more in futur using CSS. It also requires a really good big picture of the project even before starting coding. I would have to admit that my anthousiams to code made me go fast on the first design steps. I however realized that taking more time at the start to design the sections and even before coding imagine with class for css could be applied, could have decreased the use of ids and thus given a cleaner code. 
Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the project for the
