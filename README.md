# About the project 
In order to practice, developp and show my skills in HTML and CSS, I created the responsive Cripulette crochet website. Cripulette Crochet is an invented small business that offers courses and workshops to learn crochet. 
I have choosen this theme because I myself do crochet and deeply beleive that in our world where computers are omnipresent, we should all allow ourselves some time to do manual creations. 

Nevertheless, the main objective of this website is to practice with HTML and CSS. For this reason, I made the decision to use almost exclusivelly this 2 languages. I also choose to avoid the use of Bootstrap because I wanted to learn and consolidate my ability to write CSS code and to control all elements. I did use a bit of Javascript for some features but focused in HTML and CSS.


# The target audience
The target audience of Cripulette Crochet are adults crocheting or wanting to learn crochet. The offer in the website are Courses and Worshops to learn and improve to crochet as well as getting new inspirations by making creations on various themes.


# User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories
    The targeted users are adults that like doing manual work including crochet, knitting and sewing. They are likelly to have some of the following characteristics:
    1. They like to create and express themself through small pieces of ownmade art.
    2. They have the patience and enjoy spending hours doing repetive movements. 
    3. They have the will to improve their skills. 
    4. They are enthousiastic to meet other persons sharing the same hobby. 
    5. they like or need to cut themself from the digital world. 


    This last point made me raised an interresting question: How attracting people that might want to avoid media by using media? 

    I thus build the website keeping in mind this question and made design choices 
    which seemed relevant to allow users to feel in a calm and cosy environment while browsing the website


-   ### Main design choices
    -   ####  Theme Colors
        Theme colors were inspirided from palettes that offer a calm feeling (details in credits) while stimulating the curiosity and thus the creativity by adding a Yellow-Orange color. This last color was inspired by the color of a ball of wool present in the cover picture.

     -   ####   Background
         A picture for the background was added to give a 3D feelling and to give the sensation that the bacground could be touched. I explect that many of the users like to touch tissues and surfaces and thus I added a background that gives this sensation.
        For a visual cohesion, the image was also used for the headings and footer and colors on top were 0.7 transparent to permit a subtil visualisation of the background image.
            
     -   ####   Pictures
         1. Homepage
        For the design of the homepage, I wanted to focus on the process of creation and not on a final creation. That is why I have chosen pictures showing wool, crochets and the process of doing crochet.
        The reason is that I did not want to influence the imagination of the useron the homepage.
         2. Courses and Workshops
        For this page, I tried to choose pictures that illustrate the course and Worshop offered. 
         3. Gallery
        I have tried to illustrate the diversity of creations that can be made with crochet as well as different technical levels of creations. As I have been using open source images, I was limited in the picture I could use and do beleive the diversity of crochet could have been illustrated in a better way.

     -    ### Fonts
          Google fonts where used for the fonts of the website. 
        'Sacramento' was chosen for the body's font because it gives a feeling a hand writing which is, I presumed, attractive for people looking for manual activities. 
        'Josefin Slab' was chosen for the titles because it was a popular pairing suggested in google font website and I found the combinaison of these 2 fonts pleasant. Moreover, this combinaison gives in my opinion, a clean look with an artistic touch.

    -   ####   Interactivity and forms
        In purpose, few interactivity was added in the website in order to keep it simple and relaxing. Some forms with sentences from famous artist were displayed and the website was kept simple.

    -   ####   Border-radius
        Border-radius were rounded to give a sensation of tranquility.
