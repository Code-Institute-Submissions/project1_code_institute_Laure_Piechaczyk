# Project 1 for Code Institute formation | Cripullette crochet - HTML & CSS
Cripulette Crochet is a website built as part of a project for code institute (formation to become a webdeveloper) in order to developp and show my skills in HTML and CSS. 

To do this, I invented a small business that offers courses and workshops to learn crochet. I have choosen this thema because I myself like doing crochet and deeply beleive that in our world where computers are omnipresent, we should all allow ourselves some time to do manual creations. 

Nevertheless, the main objective of this website is to practice with HTML and CSS. For this reason, I made the decision to use only this 2 languages.
